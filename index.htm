  <h2>People/Movies I admire:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>3 Idiots:</strong> The motive the movie tried to convey was very simple yet very necessary: Follow your passion. The entertainment that evolved all throughout the movie was exceptional!</li>
    <li><strong>Elon Musk:</strong> A self tutored, self-motivated, super-rich genius who has overcome the odds in his businesses-Tesla and SpaceX. Replicating his success and vision to lead many other companies: NeuraLink, the Boring Company, Hyperloop, and a few others.</li>
    <li><strong>Interstellar:</strong> A visionary marvel that makes me realize the kind of larger responsibility we have towards our living ecosystem. The humans were not born to be caretakers, they were born to be explorers. This and many other emotional lessons as to how love transcends the dimensions of space.</li>
